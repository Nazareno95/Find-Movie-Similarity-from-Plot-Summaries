# Find-Movie-Similarity-from-Plot-Summaries
NLP and clustering on movie plot summaries from IMDb and Wikipedia to quantify movie similarity.

# Project Description
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an exciting field of study for data scientists where they develop algorithms that can make sense out of conversational language used by humans. In this Project, you will use NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia.

The dataset contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.
